# DeerStalker

  Our aim is to create a small-sized, portable, budget-friendly device for women’s safety. The device will be a small detachable module that can fit to a mobile’s back cover. In a moment of trouble, a distress signal is sent just by throwing one’s mobile with the device attached to it’s back cover. This is achieved by the activation of motion sensors in the module. It will also have a bluetooth component, paired with the mobile, which could  trigger audio and video recording in the mobile when a distress signal is sent. In this way, it will provide a handy method to call for help.
